# AIC-process-advanced
This work is based on the previous AIC process python code. 
The advanced version can directly process the raw data from the National Instrument machine.

It can read the interested data from different sheets of the excel and can combine the pulse data and the AIC data.

The existing problem is the initial pulse time is still need human eye to identify.
